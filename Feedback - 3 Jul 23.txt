Input Stage
- Have a dual switch for input stage, to bypass it when prototyping is done & safe
- Just Bias Signal instead of -12V
- Flip OpAmp
- Fuse may introduce noise
- Need to find the right OpAmps

Tube:
- Completeness sake, include Rg calculation
- We can also just use 80V and Drive it if it wont Clip
- "To be able to work, at the bottom of the curves is what we need"
- Add another section of calculations to operate at bottom
- Make it clear on what are choices and what are consequences
- "Load lines, Choices, Amplification"

Tone Stage:
- Put calculations on the behaviour even though the motivation was hit-and-miss

Output Stage:
- If J2 is high impedance, Just a pot will work in output instead of the OpAmp
- Again Fuse & Noise
- Again do dual switch
- Mention the rationale when to keep and when to bypass. If minimum components already gives the result we need, then go for it

Components:
- Finding Opamps
- Finding DC Convertor / Make one
