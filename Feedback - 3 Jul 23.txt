Input Stage
- Have a dual switch for input stage, to bypass it when prototyping is done & safe
- Just Bias Signal instead of -12V
- Flip OpAmp
- Fuse may introduce noise
- Need to find the right OpAmps

Tube:
- Completeness sake, include Rg calculation
- We can also just use 80V and Drive it if it wont Clip	
- "To be able to work, at the bottom of the curves is what we need"

Tone Stage:
- Put calculations on the behaviour even though the motivation was hit-and-miss

Output Stage:
- If J2 is high impedance, Just a pot will work in output instead of the OpAmp
- Again Fuse & Noise
- Again do dual switch
